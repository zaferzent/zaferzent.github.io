When I was transforming my blog into its current structure, there were a few websites I had seen before that really inspired me. The idea of sharing everything on my own site — instead of on social media — appealed to me much more.

That’s why I decided to bring different content types together here.

Today, the latest content type I added is Check-ins.
With this, I’ll now be sharing the locations of the places I visit.
