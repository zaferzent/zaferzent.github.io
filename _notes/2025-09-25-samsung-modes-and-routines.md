One of my favorite features on Samsung phones is Modes and Routines. It makes daily life so much easier by automating simple things I would otherwise have to do manually. For example, when I get close to home, it automatically turns off mobile data and connects to Wi-Fi. Another routine announces with a voice notification when the phone is fully charged.
