I really like these kinds of features on smartphones — they genuinely feel user-focused and actually useful. For example, the scheduled power on/off option. At first it sounds unnecessary, but once you start using it, you realize how practical it is.

I especially like having my phone automatically turn off at night and power back on in the morning. It keeps me away from unnecessary notifications and helps create a kind of digital discipline. It also has a small but nice impact on battery health.
