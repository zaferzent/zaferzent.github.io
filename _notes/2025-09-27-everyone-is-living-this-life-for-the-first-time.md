I once heard a saying: “Be kind to your mother, because she’s living this life for the first time.”
It stuck with me. Then I thought, why limit it to mothers? It applies to all of us. So I reshaped it, and here’s the version that became mine.

*Everyone is living this life for the first time, so don’t judge anyone by their mistakes.*

TR

*Herkes bu hayatı ilk kez yaşıyor; o yüzden hiç kimseyi hatalarıyla yadırgamayın.*
