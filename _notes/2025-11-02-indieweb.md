I've actually been following this philosophy for a while, but I only learned today that it's called IndieWeb. IndieWeb is short for Independent Web, which literally means "a web you independently own and control." In short, it's about publishing and controlling your content on your own website instead of social media — a "tweet" becomes a "note", and your domain is your identity. The idea of owning my data has always felt right to me.
