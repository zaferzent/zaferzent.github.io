I’ve been using my [Huawei Watch GT 2 Sport](https://www.zaferzent.com/huawei-watch-gt2-akilli-saat-incelemesi) for about three years now, and I think it’s finally time for an upgrade. It still meets most of my needs, but since it can’t display full message or email contents and doesn’t allow replying to incoming messages, I feel it’s time to move on. Many people prefer analog watches over digital or smart ones, but I really enjoy the convenience that technology brings. Also, due to my work, I’m not always able to access my smartphone instantly. That’s why the conveniences offered by smartwatches—such as answering calls, replying to SMS, or viewing email content—are the most important features for me. I think the model I’ll upgrade to will probably be the Huawei GT 6 or the Pro version.
