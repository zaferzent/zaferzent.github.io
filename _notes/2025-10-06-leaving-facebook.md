I deactivated my Facebook account again a few days ago. It had long ceased to be a place where I actively shared things or communicated with people. I had deactivated it years ago and didn’t use it for a long time. A couple of years ago, I reactivated it, thinking I might see some old friends and reconnect with them. However, I didn’t achieve that expectation, and over time, Facebook became just a place I occasionally checked.

Other social media platforms (except Instagram) have not been very active for me either. I’ve been using Instagram for the past 1–2 years to share the places I visit as a kind of memory. I use Twitter primarily to follow the news.

By transitioning my blog to its current structure, I plan to share both written and visual content, and in fact, I intend to distance myself further from social media.
