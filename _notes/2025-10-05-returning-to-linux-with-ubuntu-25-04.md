For over a month now, I’ve switched back to a Linux-based operating system and started using Ubuntu 25.04 (Plucky Puffin). I’m not new to Linux; in the past, I’ve always used Windows on one computer and a Linux-based OS on another.

I still use Windows 10 on my desktop, but for convenience, I mostly spend my time on my laptop. With Windows 10 support ending and my laptop not meeting some of the requirements for Windows 11 (although it can be installed in some way), choosing a fast and straightforward operating system became my priority. That’s why Ubuntu became my preference.
