Hello, I am Zafer 

I am just one of billions of people in my 30s living in Turkey who love to travel, see, explore and learn new things. 

In fact, I have been writing Turkish content on www.zaferzent.com for many years. But I wanted to have a new experience and create a separate area for language development.

Instead of sharing long and complex articles, I created this place to share the things I travelled, saw, discovered, learned and experienced in the form of short notes and perhaps photographs, and to enlarge what I shared.
